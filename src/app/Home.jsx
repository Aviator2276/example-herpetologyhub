          What is herpetology?
        </h2>
        <br className='my-2' />
        <p>
          Herpetology is the scientific study of amphibians (like frogs,
          salamanders, and newts) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards,
          turtles, crocodiles, and alligators). This specialized field of
          zoology investigates everything from their biology, ecology, and
          behavior to their evolution and conservation. Despite being distinct
          biological groups, amphibians and reptiles are often studied together
          due to historical classifications and shared characteristics, such as
          being ectothermicâ€”meaning they rely on external heat sources to
          regulate their body temperature. Understanding herpetology is crucial
          for appreciating the vital role these often-misunderstood creatures
          play in our ecosystems and for developing strategies to protect them.
